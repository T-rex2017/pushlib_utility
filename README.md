This is a shell based tool for android rom porters
Helps to push lib files to android device via adb
These are the avilable options rather than pushing
 * Tool keep track of all your doings
 * you can always revert any change you made
 * port rom files and pulled files are kept seperate
 * if device bootloops you can make a zip from backup or port and flash it
 * more comming

# Future plans
 * clean up the logging
 * accure logs from device
 * suggest if you have any ideas

# Usage
 * clone the repo
   `https://github.com/T-rex2017/pushlib_utility.git pushlib`
 
 * open the folder
   `cd pushlib`
 
 * set permissions
   `chmod +x pushlib.sh`
 
 * open the tool
   `./pushlib.sh`
 
# Thanks
 * z3r0c00l_2k for the core idea
 * All those who have made excellent tutorials on shell

# Note
 * Tool is still in development 
 * Anyone can modify or use it without my permission ( as these are just some adb and shell loop)
 * Also correct me if i have done something wrong or if thier is a better way to do something
